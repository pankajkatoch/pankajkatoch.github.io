## 1. Overview

**VoiceAssist** is designed to help individuals with neurodegenerative conditions overcome slurred speech challenges by transforming their impaired speech into a synthesized “healthy” voice in real time. The product will initially target Indian Android users for the PoC/MVP phase, with a roadmap for expansion into US and cross-platform markets later. This document describes the technical design, chosen frameworks, and implementation strategies to achieve the product vision.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Components
- **Mobile Client (Android App):**
  - Captures slurred speech, handles UI/UX for calls, voice training, and customization.
  - Implements accessibility features (large buttons, bilingual interface).
  
- **Backend Services:**
  - **API Gateway:** Secure REST endpoints for mobile–backend communication.
  - **Voice Synthesis Inference Service:** Receives audio, runs ML model inference, and returns synthesized audio.
  - **Data Storage & Management:** Securely stores user voice recordings and usage data.
  - **Continuous Learning Pipeline:** Batch processes and retrains voice synthesis models periodically.
  
- **Real-Time Communication Layer:**
  - Utilizes protocols such as WebRTC for in-app audio streaming and real-time interaction.

### 2.2 Deployment Options
- **PoC:** Cloud-hosted inference service with a simplified architecture.
- **Future Phases:** Containerized microservices deployed on a Kubernetes cluster (or managed services on AWS, GCP, or Azure) to scale as user demand grows.

A simplified diagram (conceptually) looks as follows:
```

## 3. Machine Learning Model & Training Pipeline

### 3.1 Model Requirements
- **Real-Time Synthesis:** Convert slurred speech to a clear, personalized output with minimal latency.
- **Voice Cloning:** Capture the user’s “healthy” voice using both archival recordings and current voice samples.
- **Adaptation:** Continuously update the model to adapt to gradual speech degradation.

### 3.2 Model Options
#### **Option 1: End-to-End Deep Learning Models (e.g., Tacotron 2 + WaveRNN)**
- **Pros:**
  - High-quality, natural-sounding voice synthesis.
  - Flexibility for fine-tuning to personalized data.
- **Cons:**
  - Heavy computational requirements for both training and inference.
  - Difficult to achieve real-time performance on low-end devices without significant optimization.

#### **Option 2: Pre-built Open Source Voice Cloning Pipelines (e.g., SV2TTS)**
- **Pros:**
  - Proven in the research community for real-time voice cloning.
  - Modular components (speaker encoder, synthesizer, vocoder) allow for targeted optimizations.
- **Cons:**
  - May require considerable adaptation to handle slurred input.
  - Customization for continuous learning adds extra complexity.

#### **Option 3: Commercial APIs (e.g., Amazon Polly, Google TTS)**
- **Pros:**
  - Fast to integrate with robust infrastructure.
  - Scalable and maintained by cloud providers.
- **Cons:**
  - Typically offer generic voices; limited personalization.
  - Not optimized for adapting to progressive speech degradation.

### 3.3 Our Chosen Approach
For the **PoC**, we propose using an open-source pipeline similar to **SV2TTS** (Real-Time Voice Cloning) as it strikes a balance between quality and customizability. This pipeline will be adapted to:
- Accept slurred speech input.
- Leverage a two-step process: first, a speaker encoder to extract voice features; second, a synthesizer and vocoder for real-time output.
- Incorporate a scheduled retraining mechanism using batch-collected data.

### 3.4 Training Pipeline Details
1. **Data Collection:**  
   - Collect initial voice samples via the onboarding wizard.
   - Optionally upload archival recordings.
2. **Preprocessing:**  
   - Noise reduction, segmentation, and normalization of audio.
3. **Training/Fine-Tuning:**  
   - Fine-tune the synthesizer and vocoder on the user’s data.
   - Use transfer learning from pre-trained models.
4. **Inference Optimization:**  
   - Optimize for lower latency via model quantization or on-device inference if possible.
5. **Versioning & Continuous Learning:**  
   - Store model checkpoints and implement A/B testing for model updates.
   - Schedule batch jobs to update models as new data arrives.

## 4. Backend Infrastructure & Technologies

### 4.1 API & Server Frameworks
- **Language & Framework:**  
  - **Python** with **FastAPI** or **Flask** for rapid API development.
  - Benefits: Asynchronous handling (FastAPI) can reduce latency.
- **Pros/Cons:**
  - **FastAPI:** Modern, fast, and supports async calls (pro: lower latency; con: requires familiarity with async programming).
  - **Flask:** Simpler and more mature (pro: extensive community support; con: may not be optimal for high concurrent requests).

### 4.2 Cloud Infrastructure
- **PoC Deployment:**  
  - Use AWS EC2 instances or Google Cloud Compute Engine for initial deployment.
  - Use managed databases (e.g., AWS RDS, Firestore) for secure data storage.
- **Future Deployment:**  
  - Containerize services using Docker and orchestrate with Kubernetes (e.g., AWS EKS, GCP GKE).
  - Use serverless options (AWS Lambda) for scaling individual API functions if necessary.
  
### 4.3 Data Storage & Security
- **Storage:**  
  - Cloud buckets (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) with encryption for storing audio samples.
  - Relational or NoSQL database for user profiles, session logs, and model metadata.
- **Security:**  
  - HTTPS for all communications.
  - OAuth 2.0 / JWT for user authentication.
  - Encryption at rest and in transit.

    - **Cons:** Requires separate development for iOS in the future.
  - **Cross-Platform (e.g., Flutter, React Native):**  
    - **Pros:** Faster multi-platform development.  
    - **Cons:** Potential performance issues in real-time audio processing; less native feel.

### 5.2 UI/UX Design
- **Wireframes & Flows:**
  - **Onboarding:** Step-by-step wizard to record voice samples and set up preferences.
  - **Home Screen:** Large buttons for “Call,” “Text-to-Speech,” and “Settings.”
  - **Call Screen:** Real-time display of call status, with minimalistic design to reduce cognitive load.
- **Accessibility:**
  - High-contrast color schemes.
  - Large touch targets and simplified navigation.
  - Dual-language support (English/Hindi/Hinglish).

## 6. Continuous Learning & Model Adaptation

### 6.1 Data Capture & Pipeline
- **Consent-Based Data Collection:**  
  - Record interactions (with explicit user consent) to capture new speech data.
- **Data Processing:**  
  - Batch processing of new data, anonymization, and normalization.
- **Model Update Strategy:**  
  - Schedule retraining jobs (e.g., nightly or weekly) that incorporate new data.
  - Use a CI/CD pipeline for ML models (e.g., MLflow) to track model versions and perform A/B tests.
  
### 6.2 On-Device vs. Cloud Inference
- **On-Device Inference (High-End Devices):**  
  - **Pros:** Lower latency, offline capability.  
  - **Cons:** Device heterogeneity, increased app size.
- **Cloud-Based Inference (Broader Reach):**  
  - **Pros:** Easier to update and maintain; scalable on robust infrastructure.  
  - **Cons:** Potential latency, dependency on network quality.
  
For the **PoC**, cloud inference is preferable due to simpler deployment and centralized model updates.
